# Ships inside the release tarball and runs ON the Venus OS device to install
# the release into INSTALL_DIR (default /data/dbus-pump). It is invoked
# by the auto-deploy webhook (../inverter-monitoring) or manually:
#
#     sh update.sh [INSTALL_DIR]
#
# This script owns all layout knowledge (runtime files, daemontools services,
# /service symlinks, device-local file preservation, restart order) so that
# callers like the webhook never need to hardcode where files go. Adding a new
# module or a new daemontools service requires a change here only.

# 1c. Reap stale daemontools supervise processes left behind by earlier
#     updates. Every time a service dir under $INSTALL_DIR/service is replaced
#     the inode changes, so svscan spawns a NEW supervise and the old one is
#     never killed - they linger forever with "(deleted)" cwd. Several
#     supervisors on one service corrupt runit state (broken log pipes that
#     crash print() with EPIPE, and down services that svc -u cannot bring up).
#     The same inode churn also orphans the run processes themselves
#     (cwd == $INSTALL_DIR): when a supervise dies, svc -dk can no longer
#     reach its child, so it keeps running the old code and hammering D-Bus
#     next to the new instance. Drop the /service symlinks first so svscan
#     does not respawn supervisors while we replace the dirs below, then kill
#     anything whose cwd lives under our install tree. Fresh
#     supervisors are spawned in step 6.
